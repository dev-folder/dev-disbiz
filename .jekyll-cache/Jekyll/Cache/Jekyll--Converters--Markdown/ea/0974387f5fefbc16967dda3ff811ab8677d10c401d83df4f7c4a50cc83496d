<p>Since I started working in business I have often needed to look for advice on a way of tackling a situation due to my disability. There was never a place I could go to, there were many mummyâ€™preneur groups, LGBT groups, ethnic minority groups etc but I could never find a good one that represented me in business. Donâ€™t get my wrong there are disability support groups, but they often tend to be political or bashing on the bad side of life.</p>

<p>So I decided I would setup my own project. Itâ€™s called â€˜disBizâ€™ which is short for â€˜disabled businessâ€™ and the aim is to provide informative and constructive advice for building/running a business with a disability. There are many business advice websites already, but disBiz is more aimed at business through a disabled eye. Itâ€™s a lot more focused on disability specifics.</p>

<p>It is a project that I have often needed through starting and running my business. A place I can go where there are people in the same boat and have faced the same issues as me. I hope this project helps many people for the future.</p>
